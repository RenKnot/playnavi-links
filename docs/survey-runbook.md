# Survey web runbook

## Delivery path and intentionally new server surface

This repository previously deployed only static files and two rewrites. That
path cannot issue an HttpOnly cookie. The survey keeps the existing static SPA
delivery, and adds the minimum server surface supported by Vercel: Node.js
Functions in `api/`. Vercel gives filesystem Functions precedence over the
final SPA catch-all rewrite.

| Concern | Reused evidence | Intentional difference | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production host | `links.playnavilab.com` association files and SPA catch-all | `/surveys/:slug` is added ahead of the catch-all | `tests/static-config.test.mjs` |
| API forwarding | Existing same-origin short-link proxy | Survey calls are server-side Functions so credentials never enter browser JS | `tests/server-security.test.mjs` |
| Sensitive entry URL | Existing short links use `no-store`, `no-referrer`, `noindex` | Handoff code uses a URL fragment and is removed before the first fetch | source invariant test |
| Login | App already uses Google/Apple provider identities | Web verifies provider tokens directly, then exact-matches the provider subject without invoking Supabase signup | source invariant test + pre-production login matrix |
| Survey UI | Existing static no-build UI | Declarative questions and draft persistence are added | `tests/survey-contract.test.mjs` |

`assets/app.mjs` loads `survey-app.mjs` dynamically only after matching
`/surveys/<slug>`. A missing or invalid Survey module therefore shows a
Survey-specific retry state without preventing `/`, `/s/*`, game, user or
catalog links from starting. `tests/app-entrypoint.test.mjs` executes the entry
point with the Survey module intentionally absent and proves both boundaries.

History checks used for this design:

- `git log -S'api/share-links' -- .` identifies `d0c6d88`, the successful
  same-origin proxy/static fallback pattern.
- `git log -S'supabase' -- .` identifies `bb8d9c2`, the existing Supabase
  Function rewrite pattern.
- No earlier HttpOnly, SameSite, survey, SSR, or runbook implementation exists
  in this repository.

## Environment variables

Configure these in Vercel for Production and the intended Preview environment.
Never prefix them with `PUBLIC_` or expose them to browser assets.

| Variable | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Exact project URL paired with `PLAYNAVI_WEB_ORIGIN`; production: `https://irbtguncoatqfikctreq.supabase.co`, staging: `https://wffhdhdxdrmobgojxddo.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Publishable/anon project key; never the service-role key |
| `PLAYNAVI_WEB_ORIGIN` | Exact reviewed origin; production: `https://links.playnavilab.com`, staging: `https://survey-stg.playnavilab.com` |
| `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | Dedicated Google Web OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Dedicated Google Web OAuth client secret |
| `APPLE_WEB_SERVICES_ID` | Apple Services ID associated with the existing primary App ID |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID used as the client-secret issuer |
| `APPLE_WEB_KEY_ID` | Key ID for the Sign in with Apple private key |
| `APPLE_WEB_PRIVATE_KEY` | Complete PKCS#8 `.p8` contents, including header/footer and line breaks |
| `SURVEY_WEB_BACKEND_SECRET` | Independent 256-bit+ broker secret, identical to Supabase `SURVEY_WEB_BACKEND_SECRET` |
| `SURVEY_HANDOFF_EXCHANGE_FUNCTION` | Optional; default `survey-handoff-exchange` |
| `SURVEY_PROVIDER_SESSION_CREATE_FUNCTION` | Optional; default `survey-provider-session-create` |
| `SURVEY_DEFINITION_FUNCTION` | Optional; default `survey-read` |
| `SURVEY_SUBMIT_FUNCTION` | Optional; default `survey-submit` |

Provider private keys and broker secrets are server-only Vercel variables. Never put them
in `vercel.json`, browser assets, Preview comments, or source control.

`api/_lib/config.mjs` treats the two origin/project combinations above as a
single environment identity. It rejects production-to-staging swaps, staging-to-production
swaps, other PlayNavi subdomains, and unreviewed Supabase projects. A new domain or project
therefore requires a reviewed source change in addition to a Vercel environment-variable
change.

## Recipient-facing deployment protection boundary

The Survey URL opened by an app recipient must use a fixed PlayNavi-controlled
host and must not contain a developer, account, or team slug. It also must not
be protected by Vercel Authentication. That screen authenticates a Vercel
project member; it is not a PlayNavi login and must never be shown to a
respondent. Use a separate public staging project and a fixed staging domain
under PlayNavi-managed DNS. A Vercel branch-preview alias is not a recipient
URL, even when a Deployment Protection Exception could make it public.
Application-layer handoff/session/provider checks remain mandatory.

This repository also serves production Steam callbacks and short-link
resolution. Their external Supabase rewrites are host-allowlisted to
`links.playnavilab.com` and `playnavi-links.vercel.app`. Every other host,
including the Survey staging host, receives a local private `404` for those two
paths and cannot reach the production Supabase project. Keep the guarded routes
ahead of their local deny fallback and the SPA catch-all; verify the ordering
with `tests/static-config.test.mjs` before deploying either project.

Do not append a Shareable Link or automation-bypass secret to the app URL.
Those values are deployment credentials and would be exposed in the client
handoff. Before giving a build to a tester, an unauthenticated request to the
exact `/surveys/{slug}` URL must return the PlayNavi page with HTTP 200 and must
not redirect to `vercel.com/sso-api`. A redirect is a release-stopping staging
configuration error.

## Server contract

The app creates a handoff with `survey-handoff-create` and puts only the opaque
code in `#handoff`. The Vercel server consumes it through:

```text
POST survey-handoff-exchange { code }
-> { status: "ok", survey_slug, session_token, expires_at }
```

Google uses state, nonce, and S256 PKCE. Apple uses state, nonce, a single-use
five-minute authorization code, and the signed Apple client secret. Apple's
published REST authorization/token parameter lists do not define
`code_challenge`/`code_verifier`, so this implementation does not send an
undocumented Apple PKCE parameter. Both returned ID tokens are verified against
the provider JWKS and exact issuer, audience, expiry, and nonce constraints.
The callback then calls:

```text
POST survey-provider-session-create
X-PlayNavi-Web-Secret: <independent 256-bit broker secret>
{ survey_slug, provider: "google" | "apple", provider_subject }
-> { status: "ok", survey_slug, session_token, expires_at }
```

The privileged Supabase function exact-matches
`auth.identities(provider, provider_id)` and an active PlayNavi profile. It
does not create a user and never merges on email. Only `session_token` is set
for at most 60 minutes as
`__Host-pn_survey_session; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`. Read and
submit send it server-to-server as `X-PlayNavi-Survey-Session`; it is never
returned in browser JSON. The cookie is removed after a successful submit
response; the hashed DB session naturally expires so a lost response can be
retried idempotently.

```text
POST survey-read { survey_slug }
POST survey-submit { survey_slug, answers, submission_token }
```

`answers` is an object keyed by question ID. Values are a string for single
choice/short text and a unique string array for multiple choice. The server
contract and client parser are covered by `tests/survey-contract.test.mjs`.
`submission_token` is a browser-generated 32-byte base64url value kept beside
the draft in `sessionStorage`. The same token is reused for a retry, only its
SHA-256 hash is stored, and it contains no UID or answer data.

### PlayNavi Voice schema v2

The campaign definition uses `survey.schema_version = 2` and
`questions.kind = "playnavi_voice_2026"`. The Web client accepts only the
bounded contract shared with `survey-read` / `survey-submit`: exactly seven
categories, 26 unique features, seven future candidates, 200-character
comments, an optional second category, and a maximum future Top 3. Unknown
definition keys fail closed. Schema v1 remains available for existing generic
surveys.

The answer object has exactly these keys:

```text
usage_frequency
overall_satisfaction
feature_priorities  (all 26 feature IDs)
feature_comments    (optional subset; reused by the detail step)
category_top        (required first, optional second; unique)
feature_details     (exact features in the selected one or two categories)
future_interest     (yes / none / unsure)
future_top          (yes: required first and optional second/third; otherwise empty)
```

The browser proxy accepts the nested v2 object but retains a 64 KiB serialized
body boundary. Campaign-specific keys, counts, option membership, selected
category/detail equality, rank uniqueness, and comment length are revalidated
by `survey-submit`; the browser validator is a convenience and not a trust
boundary.

The mobile flow is intro, basic questions, seven category pages, category
Top 1/optional Top 2, one page per selected category (maximum eight detailed
features), future-interest/ranking, and review. It avoids matrices and
drag-only ranking. Progress and bottom navigation remain visible, controls are
at least 48px high, optional comments are collapsed, drafts stay in
`sessionStorage`, the first invalid control receives focus, and reduced-motion
preferences disable step transitions.

### PlayNavi Voice reviewed schema v3

Schema v3 (`questions.kind = "playnavi_voice_2026_reviewed"`) is additive: v1
generic surveys and the frozen v2 campaign continue to parse and render with
their existing question and answer contracts. V3 implements the reviewed Q1–Q12
flow, including usage-based branches, optional needs and unused-feature fields,
unordered maximum-three selections, an explicit single priority, candidate-
specific detail questions, and the conditional improvement/candidate
comparison. Feature and future-candidate display orders are randomized once,
persisted in the draft, and submitted for order-effect analysis; scale and
exclusive options stay fixed.

The login notice must match the anonymous storage contract. The response row
stores answers and the hash of `submission_token`, but no UID and no join to the
reward record. For an authenticated response the UID is used only inside the
same transaction to grant the campaign title, then is not retained with or
linked from the answer. Guest responses use the same anonymous response shape
and receive no title. Reporting returns aggregates without comments, raw
answers, token hashes, or identity data.

### PlayNavi Voice segmented schema v4

Schema v4 (`questions.kind = "playnavi_voice_2026_reviewed_segments"`) uses the
new staging slug `playnavi-voice-2026-stg-review-v2`. Do not overwrite the v3
definition or reuse its slug. The v1, v2, and v3 read, draft, validation, and
rendering branches remain available unchanged.

V4 retains the complete v3 Q1–Q12 contract and adds four segment questions:

```text
S1 play_time_4w             required for everyone
S2 primary_play_device_4w   required only for a positive S1 time band; otherwise ""
S3 info_seek_days_4w        required for everyone
S4 recording_preference     required for everyone
```

The answer object has exactly 27 keys: all 22 v3 keys plus those four keys and
`reference_period_end_on`. The reference period is 28 days in `Asia/Tokyo` and
ends one day before the v4 draft is first created. The browser stores that ISO
date with the same-tab draft and must not recalculate it on reload. A changed S1
clears only a now-hidden S2 value; it must not alter S3, S4, or Q1–Q12.

The exact definition metadata is:

```text
reference_period_days = 28
reference_period_timezone = Asia/Tokyo
reference_period_end_offset_days = 1
```

The Web proxy continues to accept only `{ answers, submission_token }` and
forwards the existing `{ survey_slug, answers, submission_token }` envelope.
It detects v4-only keys before v3 so that a 27-key body cannot fall through to
the v3 or generic validator. The anonymous response/reward separation, PC Web
candidate copy and its five detailed uses, 64 KiB limit, retry token, and
same-origin/session boundaries are unchanged.

Before a v4 rollout, run `npm test` and confirm both v4 real-Chrome snapshots,
the fixed-period reload test, S2 pruning, the exact 27-key payload, and all v1,
v2, and v3 regression tests. Deploy Web, Edge, and the inactive v4 campaign in
a coordinated staging window; stop if any layer reports a different definition
key, answer key, stable option ID, schema version, or slug.

## External authentication setup

1. Register exact callback `https://links.playnavilab.com/api/auth/callback`
   on both the dedicated Google Web client and Apple Services ID. Do not allow
   arbitrary production paths or hosts.
2. Associate the Apple Services ID with the same primary App ID used by the
   native PlayNavi identity. Store the Team ID, Key ID, and complete Sign in
   with Apple `.p8` private key only as sensitive server-side variables. The
   Web Function generates a five-minute client-secret JWT immediately before
   each Apple token exchange; never store a pre-generated client-secret JWT.
3. Provision a new 256-bit broker secret in both Vercel and Supabase. It must
   not be the Supabase service-role key. Rotate it independently.
4. Rotate the Apple private key only after compromise, revocation, or an
   intentional Apple account/key change. Replace the Vercel key before revoking
   the old Apple key so login does not lose its only valid signer.
5. Do not enable analytics, session replay, Sentry request-body capture, or
   Vercel request-body logging on survey routes.

## Pre-production checks

Run locally:

```sh
npm test
npm run validate:android
```

Deploy in this order: Backend schema/RPC and Supabase Functions first, then the
Web client, then create and activate a new schema-v3 staging slug. A v3 slug
must never be exposed while either side still rejects its contract. Use an
isolated Preview and do not use a production handoff code in Preview.

Test all of the following before production promotion:

1. Handoff-capable 4.2.2 Google user and Apple user: fragment disappears before any request;
   no login prompt; correct existing PlayNavi profile receives one response and
   at most one reward.
2. App versions without handoff support, plus direct-Web Google and Apple users: the direct provider callback returns
   to a clean survey URL and resolves the exact existing provider subject. Test
   with the same provider used in the app. A different provider, Apple relay
   identity, email-only match, or provider account without a PlayNavi profile
   is rejected rather than created or merged.
3. Expired, reused, malformed, and wrong-survey handoff codes fail closed.
4. Refresh during entry preserves the draft in `sessionStorage`; successful or
   already-submitted completion removes it.
5. Closed/not-yet-open surveys, invalid answers, retry, already answered, and
   newly awarded title displays match the API result.
6. Browser storage contains no provider/Supabase access, ID, or refresh token.
   The only durable auth cookie is opaque (not JWT-shaped, including no `eyJ`
   prefix), expires in at most 60 minutes, and cookies
   have `__Host-`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Path=/`.
7. Vercel logs, Supabase Function logs, Sentry, Referer, browser history, and
   analytics contain no UID, answers, handoff/session token, or request body.
8. The provider callback's query authorization code is protocol-required,
   single-use, short-lived, and immediately receives a `303` with `no-store`
   and `no-referrer`. Confirm platform access logs do not retain query strings.
9. Responses carrying user state have `Cache-Control: private, no-store` and
   survey documents have strict CSP and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

Rollback is a normal Vercel deployment rollback plus disabling the survey
definition. Do not delete responses or revoke unrelated user sessions.

## Production stop conditions

Do not deploy or advertise the common URL until all of these are true:

- Google/Apple production callbacks, server secrets, and Apple private-key
  ownership are configured and independently reviewed.
- The Supabase provider-session function enforces the broker secret with a
  constant-time comparison and exact `(provider, provider_id)` lookup only.
- Staging proves native existing UID equals the subject-matched Web UID for one
  real Google and one real Apple account, while auth identity/profile row counts
  do not increase. Different-provider and Apple relay/email-only cases fail.
- Staging proves malformed/reused handoffs and forged provider-session calls
  fail, broker/provider/session values never reach logs, and no Supabase signup
  endpoint is called by the Web implementation.
- The production logging configuration is known not to retain OAuth callback
  query strings. The standard provider authorization code is unavoidable in a
  redirect-mode callback, but is single-use, short-lived, state/nonce-bound
  (and Google PKCE-bound), immediately removed by `303`, and never app-logged.
